# ATSAMx7x Rust PACs

This repository holds the PACs (Peripheral Access Crates) that supports and enable working with Microchip SAM S70/E70/V70/V71-based devices using Rust. Originally hosted in [atsamx7x-rust](https://github.com/atsams-rs/atsamx7x-rust) has been moved here to ease maintain and versioning in one Cargo Workspace.

The PACs are generated by SVD files provided by Microchip, publically available at at the [Microship Packs Repository](https://packs.download.microchip.com/).

## Development

This repository employs a [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/): development occurs on `development` with short-lived branches that merges into it.
When a release is met, for example a `v0.3.2` release, a `release/v0.3.x` branch is spun of `development` and the release tagged. If this branch already exists, relevant commits are back-ported instead.

Development is done towards `development`.

## Building

Install the ARMv7-EM target:
```sh
$ rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```
and build the examples:
```sh
# <TBD>
```

## Flashing the device
Refer to the [SAM V71 Xplained Ultra README](boards/atsamv71_xult/README.md).
